@dev Replacement for Solidity's `transfer`: sends `amount` wei to\n `recipient`, forwarding all available gas and reverting on errors.\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884[EIP1884] increases the gas cost\n of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit\n imposed by `transfer`, making them unable to receive funds via\n `transfer`. {sendValue} removes this limitation.\n https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/[Learn more].\n IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be\n taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities.
